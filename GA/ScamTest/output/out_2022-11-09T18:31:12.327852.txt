The Martians se
em to have calc
ulated their de
scent with amaz
ing subtlety—th
eir mathematica
l learning is e
vidently far in
 excess of ours
—and to have ca
rried out their
 preparations w
ith a well-nigh
 perfect unanim
ity. Had our in
struments permi
tted it, we mig
ht have seen th
e gathering tro
uble far back i
n the nineteent
h century. Men 
like Schiaparel
li watched the 
red planet—it i
s odd, by-the-b
ye, that for co
untless centuri
es Mars has bee
n the star of w
ar—but failed t
o interpret the
 fluctuating ap
pearances of th
e markings they
 mapped so well
. All that time
 the Martians m
ust have been g
etting ready. D
uring the oppos
ition of eighte
en ninety four 
a great light w
as seen on the 
illuminated par
t of the disk, 
first at the Li
ck Observatory,
 then by Perrot
in of Nice, and
 then by other 
observers. Engl
ish readers hea
rd of it first 
in the issue of
 Nature dated A
ugust 2. I am i
nclined to thin
k that this bla
ze may have bee
n the casting o
f the huge gun,
 in the vast pi
t sunk into the
ir planet, from
 which their sh
ots were fired 
at us. Peculiar
 markings, as y
et unexplained,
 were seen near
 the site of th
at outbreak dur
ing the next tw
o oppositions. 
The storm burst
 upon us six ye
ars ago now. As
 Mars approache
d opposition, L
avelle of Java 
set the wires o
f the astronomi
cal exchange pa
lpitating with 
the amazing int
elligence of a 
huge outbreak o
f incandescent 
gas upon the pl
anet. It had oc
curred towards 
midnight of the
 twelfth; and t
he spectroscope
, to which he h
ad at once reso
rted, indicated
 a mass of flam
ing gas, chiefl
y hydrogen, mov
ing with an eno
rmous velocity 
towards this ea
rth. This jet o
f fire had beco
me invisible ab
out a quarter p
ast twelve. He 
compared it to 
a colossal puff
 of flame sudde
nly and violent
ly squirted out
 of the planet,
 “as flaming ga
ses rushed out 
of a gun.” A si
ngularly approp
riate phrase it
 proved. Yet th
e next day ther
e was nothing o
f this in the p
apers except a 
little note in 
the Daily Teleg
raph, and the w
orld went in ig
norance of one 
of the gravest 
dangers that ev
er threatened t
he human race. 
I might not hav
e heard of the 
eruption at all
 had I not met 
Ogilvy, the wel
l-known astrono
mer, at Ottersh
aw. He was imme
nsely excited a
t the news, and
 in the excess 
of his feelings
 invited me up 
to take a turn 
with him that n
ight in a scrut
iny of the red 
planet. In spit
e of all that h
as happened sin
ce, I still rem
ember that vigi
l very distinct
ly: the black a
nd silent obser
vatory, the sha
dowed lantern t
hrowing a feebl
e glow upon the
 floor in the c
orner, the stea
dy ticking of t
he clockwork of
 the telescope,
 the little sli
t in the roof—a
n oblong profun
dity with the s
tardust streake
d across it. Og
ilvy moved abou
t, invisible bu
t audible. Look
ing through the
 telescope, one
 saw a circle o
f deep blue and
 the little rou
nd planet swimm
ing in the fiel
d. It seemed su
ch a little thi
ng, so bright a
nd small and st
ill, faintly ma
rked with trans
verse stripes, 
and slightly fl
attened from th
e perfect round
. But so little
 it was, so sil
very warm—a pin
’s head of ligh
t! It was as if
 it quivered, b
ut really this 
was the telesco
pe vibrating wi
th the activity
 of the clockwo
rk that kept th
e planet in vie
w. As I watched
, the planet se
emed to grow la
rger and smalle
r and to advanc
e and recede, b
ut that was sim
ply that my eye
 was tired.
